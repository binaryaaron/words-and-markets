# Data Mining Project


## Twitter, Markets, and Networks

An attempt to do something silly, predicting economic market movements using
topic sentiment scoring via AFINN and latent semantic indexing. I have more
interest in using the twitter data as a point of study and learning for various
topics in data mining and machine learning and my partner has an interest in
economic prediciton. Data consists of 86,000,000 tweets and a report will 
follow when it's ready to post.
