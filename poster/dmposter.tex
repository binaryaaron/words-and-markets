          \begin{itemize}
          \item Twitter is a microblogging service with 284 million monthly
            active users who post 500 million updates (``tweets'') per day.
          \item Latent Semantic Indexing is a technique used to summarize
            words (documents) into representative ideas similar to primary
            component analysis.
          \item The AFINN semantic indexing database assigns coded valence
            values to common words to allow quantification of a set of word's
            ``mood''.

          NASDAQ market data was also collected over the same period. Tweets
          were preprocessed to remove common stopwords and latent semantic
          indexing was performed on one-hour bag-of-words bins of tweets,
          giving a total of xxx hours included in analysis. Each hour bin's LSI
          topics were scored using the AFINN database, resulting in a single
          number indicating semantic valence for each hour. The LSI score was
          smoothed using rolling means (Figure \ref{fig:rollingmeans} and
          assessed for periodicity.  semantic data was combined with the stock
          data for visualization and analysis. A vector autoregressive (VAR)
          model was performed to assess the predictive power of the semantic
          data against the stock data.

       Using LSI would provide something like the following topic:

     \block{Columns}{
       By default, blocks are arranged in a single column. If you want
       multiple columns for your poster, you may use the
       \texttt{columns} environment. For example, 
       \begin{quote}
         \texttt{\noindent \bs begin\{columns\}\\
         \bs column\{.6\}\\
         \bs block\{\dots\}\{\dots\}\\
         \bs column\{.4\}\\
         \bs block\{\dots\}\{\dots\}\\
         \bs block\{\dots\}\{\dots\}\\
         \bs end\{columns\}
       }
     \end{quote}
     will create two columns of 60\% and 40\% the available width;
     spacing between successive columns is handled automatically.  The
     block command(s) following \texttt{\bs column} are the blocks to
     go in that column.  The number of columns is free to be chosen, but
     the relative widths must all be chosen.  If the widths sum to less
     than 1, empty space will be seen on the right.  If they sum to more than
   1, the latter columns will be cut off.  }
