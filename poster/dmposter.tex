   \block{Background}{
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Twitter is a microblogging service with 284 million monthly
         active users who post 500 million updates (``tweets'') per day.
       \item Latent Semantic Indexing is a technique used to summarize
         words (documents) into representative ideas similar to primary
         component analysis.
       \item The AFINN semantic indexing database assigns coded valence
         values to common words to allow quantification of a set of word's
         ``mood''.
     \end{itemize}

     We collected tweets using the public Twitter Streaming RESTful API
     over 2014-10-15 \textemdash 2014-11-09 by tracking words that related
     to various tech stocks indexed by NASDAQ.

     NASDAQ market data was also collected over the same period. Tweets
     were preprocessed to remove common stopwords and latent semantic
     indexing was performed on one-hour bag-of-words bins of tweets,
     giving a total of xxx hours included in analysis. Each hour bin's LSI
     topics were scored using the AFINN database, resulting in a single
     number indicating semantic valence for each hour. The LSI score was
     smoothed using rolling means (Figure \ref{fig:rollingmeans} and
     assessed for periodicity.  semantic data was combined with the stock
     data for visualization and analysis. A vector autoregressive (VAR)
     model was performed to assess the predictive power of the semantic
     data against the stock data.

     Using LSI would provide something like the following topic:

   \block{VAR model results}{
    Vector Autoregression (VAR) models are used to model multivariate time
    series. They describe a set of $k$ variables as a linear function of
    their previous values. A $p$-th order VAR model is denoted by
    $y_t = c + A_1 y_{t-1} + A_2 y_{t-2} + \cdots + A_p y_{t-p} + e_t$
    A VAR model is often used with a lag operator that operates on the
    elements of a time series to produce the previous element. We determined
    the lag order by employing an information criteria-based order selection.
